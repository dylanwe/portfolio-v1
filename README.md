# Portfolio-v1
A website to showcase me and my projects

My first portfolio was inspired by Apple, Medium, Notion and GitHub. Most of these sites have some sort of article layout, I thought it would be useful to do something similar, so I can explain all of my projects.

In general, the website is quite simple, this is because the focus should be mainly on the text.
